# 📦 CardProject

**CardProject** is the **first project** in my *30 Days React Learning Challenge*.

This project helped me understand how a React application is created, structured, and how data flows between components.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The purpose of this project was to:
- Understand React project structure
- Learn how components work together
- Practice passing data using props
- Render dynamic UI using array methods

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Learned

### 🔹 Creating a React Application
- Setting up a React project using modern tools
- Understanding folder and file roles

---

### 🔹 React File Hierarchy

I learned how React renders an application step by step:

index.html
↓
main.jsx
↓
App.jsx
↓
Child Components


- `index.html` → Root HTML file
- `main.jsx` → Entry point where React mounts
- `App.jsx` → Parent component
- Child components → UI building blocks

---

### 🔹 ESLint & Code Quality

- Learned what **ESLint** is and why it matters
- Understood how ESLint:
  - Enforces consistent code style
  - Helps catch errors early
  - Makes team collaboration easier
- Learned to fix lint warnings instead of ignoring them

---

### 🔹 Props & Component Communication

- Passing data from parent to child using **props**
- Understanding **props drilling**
- Making components reusable and dynamic

---

### 🔹 Rendering Data Using `.map()`

- Using JavaScript array **`.map()`** method to render multiple cards
- Understanding the importance of `key` props
- Writing clean JSX for repeated UI elements

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- React follows a **component-based architecture**
- Data flows **one way (parent → child)**
- Clean structure and linting are important even in small projects
- Practical projects make learning faster and clearer
