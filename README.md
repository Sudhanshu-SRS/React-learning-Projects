# 🚀 30 Days React Learning Challenge

Hi, I’m **Sudhanshu** 👋  
This repository documents my **30 Days React Learning Challenge**, where I am building multiple React projects to strengthen my understanding of React through hands-on practice.

The goal of this challenge is to **learn React by building real projects**, understanding core concepts, project structure, and best practices used in real-world development.

## 🎯 Challenge Objectives

- Learn React fundamentals to intermediate concepts in 30 days
- Build small-to-medium React projects
- Understand component architecture and data flow
- Practice clean, readable, and team-friendly code
- Track and showcase my learning journey publicly

## 📂 Repository Structure

This is a **single Git repository containing multiple independent React projects**.

Each project:

- Is independent
- Has its own `package.json`
- Focuses on specific React concepts
